<p>An elevated blood pressure reading means that your blood pressure falls just above the normal level, corresponding to a systolic pressure between 120 and 129 or a diastolic pressure of 80 or less. The new guidelines eliminate the previous category of prehypertension. About one-fourth of Americans have elevated levels and they have two times the risk of heart disease compared with those who have lower blood pressures. Lifestyle changes can help many people with prehypertension lower their blood pressure.</p>
<h4>Causes</h4>
<p>Factors that increase your blood pressure can cause elevated levels. Medications such as birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers, and some prescription drugs may cause a temporary rise in blood pressure. The buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries (atherosclerosis) can also lead to prehypertension. Other conditions that may lead to prehypertension include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obstructive sleep apnea</li>
<li>Kidney disease</li>
<li>Adrenal disease</li>
<li>Thyroid disease</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>There are usually no symptoms with elevated blood pressure. The only way to keep track of your blood pressure is to visit your doctor regularly and have your blood pressure checked.</p>
<h4>Treatment</h4>
<p>If elevated blood pressure levels are accompanied by diabetes, kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease, your doctor may suggest blood pressure medication as well as lifestyle changes. If elevated levels are your only condition, lifestyle changes can help prevent blood pressure from rising. The following are lifestyle changes that may help lower blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Losing weight if overweight or obese</li>
<li>Eating a healthy, low-salt diet</li>
<li>Exercise regularly</li>
<li>Limit alcohol consumption</li>
<li>Quit smoking</li>
</ul>
