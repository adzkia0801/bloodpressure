<p>Hypertension may not produce any symptoms, even if you have had it for years. That&rsquo;s why it is sometimes referred to as a "silent killer." It&rsquo;s estimated that 1 out of every 5 people with high blood pressure aren&rsquo;t aware that they have this major risk factor for strokes and heart attacks. If not properly treated, high blood pressure can damage the heart and circulation, lungs, brain, and kidneys without causing noticeable symptoms. Symptoms of high blood pressure may be present in those who have an extremely high blood pressure. Symptoms of extremely high blood pressure include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe headaches</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Vision problems</li>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>Blood in the urine</li>
<li>Pounding in the chest, neck, or ears</li>
</ul>
