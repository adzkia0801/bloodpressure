<p>You are considered to have hypertension if your systolic blood pressure measurements are between 130 and 139 or your diastolic measurement falls between 80 and 89. At this level of blood pressure you may not have any symptoms. When blood pressure reaches 180/120 or higher, a serious condition known as a malignant hypertension or hypertension crisis may occur. This can lead to stroke, kidney damage, heart attacks, or loss of consciousness. If you measure your blood pressure and it is this high, rest a few minutes and measure again. If it remains high, call 911.</p>
<h4>Malignant Hypertension Causes</h4>
<p>High blood pressure is the main cause of malignant hypertension. Skipping doses of blood pressure medications can also lead to malignant hypertension. The following are medical conditions that may cause malignant hypertension:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kidney disease</li>
<li>Collagen vascular disease</li>
<li>Spinal cord injuries</li>
<li>Tumor of the adrenal gland</li>
<li>Birth control pills</li>
<li>Illegal drugs (cocaine)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Malignant Hypertension Symptoms</h4>
<p>The primary symptoms of malignant hypertension are a blood pressure of 180/120 or higher and signs of organ damage. Other symptoms of malignant hypertension include bleeding and swelling of blood vessels in the retina, anxiety, nosebleeds, severe headache, and shortness of breath. Malignant hypertension may cause brain swelling, but this symptom is very rare.</p>
<h4>Malignant Hypertension Treatment</h4>
<p>Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Blood pressure medications will be given through an IV, in hopes of lowering blood pressure within minutes. Oral medication will be given once blood pressure has been lowered to a safe level.</p>
