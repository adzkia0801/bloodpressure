<p>Women who do not have high blood pressure before pregnancy may develop gestational hypertension or preeclampsia during pregnancy. Gestational hypertension is high blood pressure that develops in pregnancy. Gestational hypertension generally develops after week 20 of pregnancy. If not properly managed, it may develop into preeclampsia.</p>
<p>Preeclampsia is elevated blood pressure and the leakage of protein into the urine by the kidneys. Preeclampsia can be dangerous to both mother and baby. High blood pressure during pregnancy may lead to decreased blood flow to the placenta, placental abruption, premature delivery, or future cardiovascular disease. After the baby is born, high blood pressure during pregnancy usually returns to normal levels.</p>
