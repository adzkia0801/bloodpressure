<p>Blood pressure is given as a reading of two numbers, such as 110/70. The higher number (systolic) is the pressure when the heart beats. The diastolic, or lower number shows the pressure between the heartbeats, while the relaxed heart is refilling with blood. Normal blood pressure readings are lower than 120/80. The cause of most hypertension is unknown. Occasionally, conditions of the kidney or adrenal gland are the cause of high blood pressure.</p>
<p>There are several factors that may cause high blood pressure, but the exact cause is unknown. The following factors may increase one&rsquo;s risk for high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Overweight or obesity</li>
<li>Lack of physical activity</li>
<li>Too much salt consumption</li>
<li>Too much alcohol consumption (more than 1 to 2 drinks per day)</li>
